This project is based on react and sass.

<br />

# Folder and File structure

## src/App.js
Serves as a router between all available pages. <br />
The pages are actually get displayed here. 

## src/components/pages
Contains the build structure and content to the pages. <br />
Main .js files(eg. Start.js, Works.js, etc.) in the root folders of each pages are called in the routing in App.js. <br />
If the page is more complex, the folder is divided into further structures: content and modules. 

## src/components/ui
Code to the reusable ui elements. The menu is defined here.

<br />

**SASS AND GULP** <br />
Most of the different components have their own scss file, named respectively the same as the .js file name of the component.<br />
Variables and general sass rules can be found in src/components.<br />
The sass conversion to css is realised with gulp.<br />
The gulpfile.js edits all scss file in the components folder into one file that is src/main.css

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
